      NODE_ENV: production

      # TZ - Timezone for the container
      TZ: Etc/UTC

      ### Overridden variables for Docker Compose setup
      # The `nightscout` service can use HTTP, because we use `traefik` to serve the HTTPS
      # and manage TLS certificates
      INSECURE_USE_HTTP: "true"

      # For all other settings, please refer to the Environment section of the README
      ### Required variables
      # MONGO_CONNECTION - The connection string for your Mongo database.
      # Something like mongodb://sally:sallypass@ds099999.mongolab.com:99999/nightscout
      # The default connects to the `mongo` included in this docker-compose file.
      # If you change it, you probably also want to comment out the entire `mongo` service block
      # and `depends_on` block above.
      MONGO_CONNECTION: mongodb://big-bear-nightscout-mongo:27017/nightscout

      # API_SECRET - A secret passphrase that must be at least 12 characters long.
      API_SECRET: 48f875fa-0e03-416f-b9d6-19c9afc4e194 # change_me

      # AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES (readable) - possible values readable, denied, or any valid role name.
      # When readable, anyone can view Nightscout without a token. Setting it to denied will require
      # a token from every visit, using status-only will enable api-secret based login.
      AUTH_DEFAULT_ROLES: denied

    # Description in English
    en_us: This acts as a web-based CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) to allow multiple caregivers to remotely view a patient's glucose data in real time. The server reads a MongoDB which is intended to be data from a physical CGM, where it sends new SGV (sensor glucose values) as the data becomes available. The data is then displayed graphically and blood glucose values are predicted 0.5 hours ahead using an autoregressive second order model. Alarms are generated for high and low values, which can be cleared by any watcher of the data.
