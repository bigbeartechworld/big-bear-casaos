        Dockhand provides modern Docker management with real-time container orchestration, Compose stack management, and multi-environment support. Authentication is disabled by default for easy setup - consider enabling it in Settings > Authentication after installation.

        **Security Note**: This app requires Docker socket access, which grants full Docker daemon privileges.
