      interval: 5s # This specifies how often the health check command should be run. In your configuration, itâ€™s set to every 5 seconds (5s). This means Docker will execute the pg_isready command every 5 seconds to check if the database server is up and ready to accept connections.

      retries: 5 # This specifies the number of consecutive failures required to consider the container as unhealthy. In your case, the pg_isready command must fail 5 consecutive times before Docker marks the container as unhealthy.
